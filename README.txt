Matt's sketches and BZFlag.

To Do
soon:
    - clean
        - use Coord everywhere
        - Remove class definitions, 
        event handlers from inside the 
        drawing function, "outout"
    - make full use of new GridMap
        - use the hash table to only
        calculate distances that are
        shown to be vaguely proximal
    - Player controls in more 
    directions
long term:
    - improve realism in Bullet class
    - make NPCs more able to go around 
    walls
        - share 'sliding' behavior with
        all Character?
    - more believable NPC behavior
        - interact with other NPCs
		- more defensive strategy
    - larger worlds
    - player can build walls
    - player can use experience to 
    access more weapons
