A 2D shooter game with tiny little dots.

Made with processing p5 and TypeScript.

To Do
soon :
    - improve the angle calculation 
    imprecision which causes NPCs to
    have poor aim
    - clean up non-polymorphic logic 
    shown by the difference in the 
    looping functions called in 
    World.draw()
long term:
    - characters can regain hp. caused 
    by:
        - food? passage of time? 
        experience?
    - make NPCs more able to go around 
    walls
        - share 'sliding' behavior with
        all Character?
    - use Coord everywhere
    - more believable NPC behavior
        - interact with other NPCs
		- more defensive strategy
    - larger worlds
    - player can build walls
